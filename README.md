# Truly Open AI

We're living in the age of intelligence, but a handful of centralized entities currently control the future of AI. The convergence of crypto and AI has led to innovative projects solving various decentralized AI problems, yet these efforts remain isolated and fragmented.

To address this, we need a comprehensive infrastructure that integrates these disparate components into a cohesive whole. An end-to-end decentralized AI system that is permissionless, censorship-resistant, and tamper-proof.

Truly Open AI is an open-source project that aims to develop this infrastructure. Let's build truly open AI together.

## Design Principles

* **Decentralize everything**. Decentralize at every step. Question every component of the system and decentralize it. Ensure that no single point of failure or control exists.
* **Everything is an agent**. Not just regular agents, every entity, whether a swarm of agents, a model storage system, a GPU node, a cross-chain agent communication bridge, or an infrastructure service, is represented as an agent.
* **Do one thing and do it well**. Each agent should have a single, well-defined purpose and perform it well.
* **Prompting as the primary interface**. All agents have a unified, simplified I/O interface with prompting and response.
* **Composable**. Agents can work together to perform complex tasks via a chain of prompts.

## Architecture

Truly Open AI is an end-to-end, production-grade, multichain infrastructure for decentralized AI agents. Its comprehensive, modular software stack lets AI developers manage them on multiple blockchains, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The platform provides advanced mechanisms for deploying, maintaining, and scaling them.
