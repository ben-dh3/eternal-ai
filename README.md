# Truly Open AI

Weâ€™re living in the age of intelligence. However, the future of AI is controlled by a few centralized entities. The intersection of crypto and AI has spawned several innovative projects that aim to solve decentralized AI, but these early experiments have been fragmented.

What is needed is an end-to-end solution that puts everything together in a cohesive, decentralized AI system. The system needs to be permissionless, censorship-resistant, and tamper-proof.

## Design Principles

* **Decentralize everything**. Decentralize at every step. Question every component of the system to decentralize it. Ensure that no single point of failure or control exists.
* **Everything is an agent**. Not just regular agents, every entity, whether a swarm of agents, an AI model storage system, a GPU node, a cross-chain agent communication bridge, or an infrastructure service, is represented as an agent.
* **Small is beautiful**. Agents should be small, efficient, and modular.
* **Do one thing and do it well**. Each agent should have a single, well-defined purpose and perform it well.
* **Prompting as the primary interface**. All agents have a unified, simplified I/O interface with prompting and response.
* **Composable**. Agents can work together to perform complex tasks.
* **Use JSON for agent configuration**. Agent configuration is stored in a simple text file.

## Architecture

Truly Open AI is an end-to-end, production-grade, multichain infrastructure for decentralized AI agents. Its comprehensive, modular software stack lets AI developers manage them on multiple blockchains, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The platform provides advanced mechanisms for deploying, maintaining, and scaling them.
